# decumar

Decumar is a tool for interleaving latex and R. It uses specially formatted comment blocks, so your file is always valid latex.

Decumar is similar to sweave, but comes from a slightly different heritage. As well as deriving inspiration from literate programming, it also draws ideas from code generation.  Why should you use decumar instead of sweave?

 * you only need one file
 * it's always valid latex
 * caching is built in
 * more types of output (figures, listing, ...)
